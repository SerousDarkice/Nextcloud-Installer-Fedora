# NextCloud-Installation-Fedora

2018-12-28 -- As of now, this script is no longer being developed.  Use at your own risk.
The point of this script was an exercise for me to become familiar with a few scripting concepts.
Exercise was fulfilled. :)

End goal is to have the one script: installer.sh

If you use the inidividual scripts, go in this order.

1.  nextcloud-packages.sh
2.  nextcloud-webserver.sh
